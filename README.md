Events participants are individuals or groups who actively take part in organized gatherings, such as conferences, 
workshops, seminars, sports tournaments, or community celebrations. They may include attendees, speakers, performers,
competitors, volunteers, or organizers, each playing a distinct role in the success of the event. Participants contribute 
through their presence, engagement, and interaction, which helps fulfill the event’s objectives—whether educational,
cultural, recreational, or professional. Their feedback and experiences often shape future events, 
making them essential to both the planning and outcome of any organized activity.
